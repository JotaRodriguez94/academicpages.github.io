abstract: 'More than 70 million people use at least one Sign Language (SL) as their main channel of communication. Nevertheless, the absence of effective mechanisms to translate massive information among sign, written and spoken languages is the main cause of a negligible inclusion of deaf people into society. Therefore, SL automatic recognition systems have widely proposed to support the characterization of the sign structure. Today, the natural and continuous SL recognition is an open research problem due to multiple spatio-temporal shape variations, challenging visual sign characterization, as well as the non-linear correlation among signs to express a message. This work introduces a compact sign to text architecture that explores motion as an alternative to support sign translation. Such characterization results robust to appearance variance with relative support to geometrical variations. The proposed representation focus on the main spatio-temporal regions to each corresponding word. The proposed architecture was evaluated in a built SL dataset (LSCDv1) dedicated to the motion study and also in the state-of-the-art RWTH-Phoenix. From LSCDv1 dataset, the best configuration reports a BLEU-4 score of 63.04 in testing set. Regarding the RWTH-Phoenix, the proposed strategy achieved a BLEU-4 score in test of 4.56 improving the results under similar reduced conditions.'
