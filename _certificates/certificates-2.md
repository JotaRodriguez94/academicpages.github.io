title: "TensorFlow Developer by deeplearning.ai on coursera"
excerpt: "In this specialization, you got a grounding in what you need to get
started with TensorFlow: In Practice. The goal was to help you
take the next steps, such as going deeper into understanding
Machine Learning and the practice of understanding loss
functions, optimizers and more, or perhaps you want to know
more about neural networks and the different types of layers,
from convolutions to recurrent or LSTM. Now that you have used
some of them and seen the impact of different layer types in
practice, you can go forward equipped to go deeper!<br/><img src='/images/certficates-2.png'>"
